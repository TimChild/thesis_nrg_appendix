# Notebook used to generate `NRG data and fitting` appendix in my PhD theis.

A jupyter notebook that demonstrates some of the basics of working with Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG) calculation results, and how to make comparison to data with them.

The NRG calculation data was provided by Yaakov Kleeorin and Yigal Meir. 

This notebook here is a minimal demonstration only. As such, all functions necessary to run the notebook are included explicitly within it. In normal use, many of the functions defined in the notebook would be defined in separate files and only included where necessary.

The analysis code I used throughough my PhD (of which this is a miniscule snippet) can be found here https://github.com/TimChild/dat_analysis. However, be warned that the full repository is a cumulation of code generated over many years, starting from being a total beginner at `python`, and was only ever intended for my own use. The contents of it by no means reflect my current coding practices.
